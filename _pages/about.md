  <div class="aboutme">
    Hello! I’m Sri Harrsha Kolli, a software developer with a strong foundation in backend development, distributed systems, and building scalable applications. I recently earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington, where I specialized in working with technologies like Node.js, React.js, Java, Python, and cloud services such as AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.<br> <br>

  My professional experience includes an internship at Ujjwal Systems, where I developed a web application to display real-time monitoring data for clients like electricity boards and solar farms. I built secure RESTful APIs, implemented authentication using JWT, and optimized MongoDB queries to handle large datasets efficiently. Additionally, I designed features for inventory and transaction management for hardware manufacturing and shipping processes.<br> <br>

  Beyond academics and work, I’ve led several projects, such as an AI-powered Career Recommendation Assistant built with GPT APIs to deliver personalized guidance, and a Learning Management System developed using React.js and Laravel(PHP). My personal projects include a Stock Trend prediction model utilizing RNN and LSTM and was published in the AIC Conference Proceedings.<br> <br>

  I’m passionate about solving challenging problems, automating processes, and creating impactful software that improves user experiences. Outside of work, I enjoy playing RPGs, exploring new technologies, and constantly learning ways to improve my craft. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.
